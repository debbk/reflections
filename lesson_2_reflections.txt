What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Commences the tracking of changes on any files in the repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area caches individual files that can be committed.  This is useful, as you can commit a group of files.
- The working directory is the base/location of the files.
- The repository contains the 'committed'/versioned files.
