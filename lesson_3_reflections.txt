When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- If there are multiple people that need to access a file, or if I need to access it remotely.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Since my remote repository is public, I would want to verify all the changes prior to pulling them
- In order to conserve memory, I also want to make sure I pull when I am able to

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Forks are used to clone repositories in GitHub without copying them to your local hard drive
- Clones copy repositories onto your hard drive
- Branches are variations of code off the master 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- You can work on your code offline and make any edits you need
- when you're back on the network, you can update/push accordingly

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- Without Git/GitHub, I could use track changes on a word document.  This might not work for code
- I could also have someone explain what they have changed, which may be time consuming.
